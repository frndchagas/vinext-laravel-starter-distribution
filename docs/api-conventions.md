# API conventions

These rules apply to every application endpoint exposed through the generated client.

## Addressing and types

- Application routes use `/api/v1`.
- Resource IDs are opaque strings backed by UUIDv7.
- Dates use ISO 8601 UTC values.
- Money uses integer minor units and a separate currency code.
- Optional and nullable fields are different concepts.

## Responses

- Resources and collections use stable shapes declared in TypeSpec.
- Errors use RFC 9457 Problem Details with machine-readable domain codes where needed.
- Validation errors include a stable field-to-messages map, validated at the client boundary in development and tests.
- Rate limits return documented `429` Problem Details with `Retry-After`.
- Potentially large collections use cursor pagination.
- Every Laravel API response carries `X-Correlation-Id`; middleware adds this cross-cutting header, which is not repeated in every generated response type today.

## Asynchronous mutations

Use `Idempotency-Key` when retrying a mutation could duplicate work. Persist the resource and initial state before dispatching after commit. Replaying the same key and validated input must return the original result; conflicting reuse returns `409`.

Realtime messages never replace the read API. A client can rebuild current state without receiving an event.

## Compatibility

HTTP changes begin in TypeSpec and include regenerated OpenAPI and client artifacts. On pull requests, oasdiff compares the proposed document with the target branch. This is not a comparison with the latest tagged release.

Protocol endpoints owned by Sanctum, Fortify or Echo may be invoked by infrastructure instead of a generated product hook. Document each exception in [Authentication](authentication.md).

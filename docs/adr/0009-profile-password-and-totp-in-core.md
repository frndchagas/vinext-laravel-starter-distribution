# ADR 0009: profile, password and TOTP in core

Status: accepted.
Implementation: complete.

The authentication core includes profile settings, password changes, appearance preferences, User deletion and TOTP two-factor authentication with recovery codes. Appearance uses browser storage and a cookie rather than persisted domain state. User deletion requires the current password and permanently removes the identity, its sessions and resources owned only by it. TOTP is available by default, but each User chooses whether to enable it. Configuration and recovery-code management require the current password. Passkeys, social login, SSO and teams remain outside the core. Laravel continues to own identity, sessions and authorization.

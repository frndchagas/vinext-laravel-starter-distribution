# Vinext Laravel Starter

A ready-to-own Laravel and Vinext application with same-origin sessions, profile and password settings, optional TOTP, generated HTTP contracts, Redis queues, Reverb and an idempotent Task example.

This repository is an application snapshot. There is no starter updater, so you can change every part of it as your product evolves.

## Start locally

Requirements: Bun 1.4+, Node.js 24+, PHP 8.3+, Composer 2.10, Docker Compose and Git.

```bash
composer run dev
```

The command installs locked dependencies, starts the local services, preserves an existing Laravel application key, runs migrations and then starts Vinext, Laravel, Horizon and Reverb.

Open the application at `http://localhost:13000` and Mailpit at `http://localhost:18025`. Register a User, verify the email through Mailpit and open Tasks to exercise the queued realtime flow.

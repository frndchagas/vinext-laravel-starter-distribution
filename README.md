# Vinext AI Starter for Laravel

[![CI](https://github.com/frndchagas/vinext-ai-starter/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/frndchagas/vinext-ai-starter/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A Laravel and Vinext foundation for coding agents.

[Live demo](https://vinext-ai-starter.dev-0.fortetecnologias.com.br) · [Deployment guide](docs/deployment.md)

The starter provides same-origin sessions, profile and password settings, optional TOTP, explicit HTTP and realtime contracts, a generated TypeScript client, role and permission storage, Redis queues, Reverb and one idempotent asynchronous flow. "AI-first" refers to repository instructions and executable gates; no AI provider ships in the current release.

Vinext is still in beta and the React Compiler integration is experimental. CI verifies local setup, browser behavior, a fresh template snapshot and the production container topology.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Bun 1.4+, Node.js 24+, PHP 8.3+, Composer 2.10, Docker Compose and Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frndchagas/vinext-ai-starter.git
cd vinext-ai-starter
cp .env.example .env
bun run bootstrap
bun run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:13000`, register a User and use Mailpit at `http://localhost:18025` to verify the email. The Tasks page demonstrates queued processing and private realtime updates.

Stable releases are also available through the Laravel installer:

```bash
laravel new my-app --using=frndchagas/vinext-ai-starter --phpunit --bun --no-boost
```

See [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md) for the expected services, shutdown steps and first validation.
